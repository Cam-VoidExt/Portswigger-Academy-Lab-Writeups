# Lab 01: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

**Date:** February 6, 2026
**Vulnerability Type:** In-band SQL Injection
**Difficulty:** Apprentice
**Status:** SOLVED

## 1. Objective
Exploit an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter to display "hidden" products that are not currently released (where `released = 0`).

## 2. Methodology
The application uses a SQL query to filter products by category. By injecting a "comment-out" sequence and a tautology (a statement that is always true), the `released = 0` requirement can be bypassed.

### Original Query:
`SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1`

### Injection Payload:
`' OR 1=1--`

## 3. Results
When the payload was appended to the category parameter, the query became:
`SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1`
Because `1=1` is always true, the database returned every item in the table, including unreleased products.

## 4. Remediation
Implement **Parameterized Queries** (Prepared Statements) to ensure that the database treats user input as a literal string rather than executable SQL code.
