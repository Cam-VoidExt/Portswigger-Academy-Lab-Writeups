# Lab 02: SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass

**Date:** February 6, 2026
**Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection (Auth Bypass)
**Difficulty:** Apprentice
**Status:** SOLVED

## 1. Objective
Bypass the login mechanism to gain access to the `administrator` account without knowing the password.

## 2. Methodology
The login functionality likely uses a query that checks both username and password. By injecting a comment sequence (`--`) after the username, the password check can be ignored by the database.

### Injection Payload (Username Field):
`administrator'--`

## 3. Results
The resulting backend query became:
`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = '...'`
The `--` sequence told the database to ignore the rest of the query, effectively logging me in as the first user returned by the query matching 'administrator'.

## 4. Remediation
Use a secure authentication framework and enforce **Parameterized Queries**. Never concatenate user input directly into authentication queries.
